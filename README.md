# Employee Tracker

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create and interface that allows a theoretical business owner to access and update a database of employee data. Through the command line, the user encounters a series of prompts with options to view table data of departments, roles, and employees. The user can also add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee's role and manager.
